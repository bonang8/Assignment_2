Changes made for grader:
 Instead of having it loop infinitely, my program is able to detect whether its stable or empty and prompt the user
 Press ‘x’ to exit instead of enter
 Capped max generation at 50 for pause mode on file output mode
 Note: lifeOne.txt, lifeTwo.txt, lifeThree.txt are my sample output files from early runs
       fileConfig.txt is the file I used to test input
       please ignore myGrid.h.gch
